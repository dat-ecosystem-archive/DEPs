This repository contains a series of "Dat Enhancement Proposal" (DEP)
documents, part of the dat protocol development and standardization process.

Accepted proposals will be viewable at [datprotocol.com](https://dat-ecosystem.github.io/datprotocol.com/).  New (draft) proposals and discussion can be viewed on [github][github-deps] under "Pull requests".

These documents might be interesting reading to anybody wanting to learn more
about protocol nitty gritties or the consensus process, but the documentation
at [https://github.com/dat-ecosystem/book/blob/master/src/SUMMARY.md][docs] is specifically written with end-users and
application developers in mind.

## The Process

TL;DR: write up an DEP markdown file; submit a github PR; revise per review;
community will either accept (merges PR) or not (closes PR). See the ["DEP
Process"][dep-0001] meta-DEP for details.

For now this process is as simple and informal; as the number of dat developers
and users grows, it may become more formal. Precedents and inspiration include:

- [Bittorrent Enhancement Proposals (BEP)](http://bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0001.html)
- [Rust RFC Process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)
- [Python Enhancement Proposal](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0001/)
